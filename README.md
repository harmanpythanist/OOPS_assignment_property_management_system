The task is to create a technical solution for a real world problem. The main focus is not the solution itself, but how we approach the problem, plan for the design of its solution and finally output a technical solution of that problem. We are going to use object oriented modeling tool, UML (Unified Modeling Language) 2.0 to design the solution of this real world scenario. UML is a graphical way of describing computer systems.
In .py files you will be able you see each class seperately and in .ipnyb file you will be able to see whole code at one place.
